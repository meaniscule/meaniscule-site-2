# Meaniscule site with i18n
This is the repo for the site that introduces Meaniscue on the web:
[meaniscule.ashryanbeats.com](http://meaniscule.ashryanbeats.com)

**Note:** This repo isn't really meant to be cloned; it's just here to show you what your code might look like if you build a site with Meaniscule. 


## Get Meaniscule
If you want to use Meansicule, go to the [Meaniscule repo](https://github.com/meaniscule/meaniscule) for instructions on how to install Meaniscule and generate an app.

## What's in this repo
As noted above, this is the repo for the live site that introduces Meaniscule:
[meaniscule.ashryanbeats.com](http://meaniscule.ashryanbeats.com)

The site *is not* the default Meaniscule app. It is a demonstration of something simple you might do with Meaniscule.

### i18n
The live site supports [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) and is localized in English and Japanese.

The i18n support is made possible by the magic of [`angular-translate`](https://angular-translate.github.io/). 

The source code is here for you to peruse, but feel free to get in touch if you have questions about i18n or L10n for Angular.

If you're using `angular-translate` and are having trouble with mojibake (non-latin alphabet characters getting garbled), [read this post I wrote on how you might deal with that problem](http://ashryanbeats.com/avoiding-mojibake-with-angular-translate/).

### Bootstrap styles
The site has some *very* basic Bootstrap styles that aren't included in the default Meaniscule app (because you might not want them). They are here on the site and site repo for demonstration purposes.
